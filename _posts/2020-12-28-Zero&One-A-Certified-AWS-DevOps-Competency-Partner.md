title: Zero&One A Certified AWS DevOps Competency Partner
---

As per [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/devops "Gartner"), DevOps is the amalgamation of agile infrastructure with agile operations. It is a set of tools and practices that aligns people and culture with the latest IT infrastructure to deliver services and products at a much faster pace.

The AWS DevOps model is a two way street between the business and its customers. The delivery pipeline builds, tests, and releases the application, while the feedback loop monitors, plans, and improvises. Therefore, DevOps is better considered as a journey than a destination as it focuses on continuous improvement in response to the external environment.

**DevOps and AWS**

Software is no longer a single entity that performs a specific function. Application modernization has made software a collaborative space where stakeholders interact. [AWS Competency Program](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/ "AWS Competency Program") brings the siloed teams into a more collaborative and trustworthy environment, resulting in better code quality and higher velocity delivery. Besides, AWS DevOps accelerate time-to-resolution and manage contingencies effectively.

If you have an AWS account already, you can immediately start DevOps for your business with AWS DevOps. AWS DevOps services provide a software package that helps in the automation of tasks while keeping the environment secure. It uses APIs and SDKs, which work like predefined templates and help the businesses to use the frameworks on their existing infrastructure.

For seamless integration, AWS organizes a full-day workshop called DevOps Day. This event offers a free hands-on experience to the new teams/ businesses willing to implement DevOps services in their current environment. [AWS Dev Day](https://aws.amazon.com/events/devday/ "AWS Dev Day") gives its attendees a chance to attend live demos and to network with AWS tech experts.

**DevOps Competency**

Amazon is serving millions of customers across all business verticals. Ranging from hospitality, manufacturing, IT services, military, education, retail to healthcare, public safety, and disaster management. The competencies are broadly defined in three categories as below.

1. _Continuous Integration And Delivery_ : This competency focuses on accelerating time-to-market by creating centralized repositories of code. Then teams build, improve, and deploy faster.

2. _Monitoring And Logging The Performance_ : This competency focuses on analyzing the performance of the applications. Since software services are expected to be working 24/7, the infrastructure performance is logged and analyzed for continuous improvement.

3. _Infrastructure As Code_ : The API driven model helps in automating operations and removes repetitive manual intervention. This approach helps in identifying unused resources and increases the overall efficiency of the teams.

Therefore, the AWS Competency Program is highly collaborative across industries using various workloads like SAP, SAAS, Microsoft Workloads, and Oracle.
