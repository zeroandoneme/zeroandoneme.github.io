---

For over 14 years, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been serving its customers by using the latest technology to support the smooth running of applications and software. In the continuous effort to make the cloud a more secure and versatile platform, Amazon plans to empower the AWS partner network with its latest list of best practices - [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/?wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-order=desc "AWS Well-Architected Framework").

Zero&One is humbled in becoming one of MENA (the Middle East and North Africa) region’s first [AWS Well-Architected partners](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/well-architected-program/ "AWS Well-Architected partners"). This means we can conduct a thorough analysis of AWS users using the Well-Architected Framework. This review will help our clients to accelerate growth, mitigate risks, and manage workloads.

Zero&One is a leading Advanced Consulting Partner of Amazon Web Services in the MENA area. We work relentlessly to reduce overall cloud costs for our customers and make their life better. Our expertise lies in clearing bottlenecks, automating processes, and providing AI and machine-based learning solutions for cloud computation.

**AWS Well-Architected Framework**

The AWS Well-Architected framework comprises 5 pillars that fit into business lenses to deliver value. AWS Well-Architected partners use this framework to review your business and identify potential risks right on time. We review your workload and incorporate pillar-based solutions to help you achieve better workload management, customer retention, visibility, and reach. When evaluated and implemented well, the best practices of this framework will keep your data secure and reliable on AWS cloud.

**5 Pillars Of The AWS Well-Architected Framework**

1. [Operations Excellence](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Operational-Excellence-Pillar.pdf "Operations Excellence")
   This pillar helps to automate the changes and manage daily operations.

2. [Security](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Security-Pillar.pdf "Security")
   This pillar focuses on privilege management, data integrity maintenance, and data confidentiality.

3. [Reliability](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Reliability-Pillar.pdf "Reliability")
   This pillar ensures dynamic resource allotment and quick recovery from failures.

4. [Performance Efficiency](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Performance-Efficiency-Pillar.pdf "Performance Efficiency")
   This pillar monitors performance and helps to make informed business decisions.

5. [Cost Optimization](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Cost-Optimization-Pillar.pdf "Cost Optimization")
   This pillar keeps the costs in check, helps to avoid overspending, and increases the ROI.

**How Does AWS Well-Architected Program Help Your Company?**

A well put through AWS Well-Architected review identifies problem areas and incorporates solutions to enhance workload management (managing and storing data with flexibility so that the short and long queries don’t get stuck in queues). Through this program, we help you to reduce your costs and automate your workflows so that you can focus on your product and client experience.

Three Benefits of AWS Well-Architected Program For Your Company

1. _Effective Risk Management_ : Amazon Web Services’ robust Well-Architected Program enables businesses to identify their current tech risks and to continuously monitor their security alerts. This helps organizations to mitigate high-risk areas by identifying solutions well-in advance.

2. _Reduced Cost_ : Privilege management (data access rights based on role and requirements) will prevent the occurrence of fraud and security thefts. Thus, curbing overspend on recoveries. With better recovery planning and dynamic resource allotment, systems become more resilient and perform to the maximum capacity.

3. _Efficient Workflow_ : An efficient workflow helps to optimize the workloads. The program will help in identifying idle resources and distribute them with better placement and strategy. A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) driven approach makes the workflow refined and increases operational performance.

The ultimate goal of the AWS partner network program is to help you grow your business faster, better, and with enhanced customer engagement.

**How Can Zero&One Help You To Achieve AWS Well-Architected Status?**

Zero&One works with clients to elevate, operate, and innovate their businesses by cloud adoption and management, data analytics, and cloud-native development across IoT devices.

Once you book a review with [Zero&One](https://zeroandone.me/index.html "Zero&One"), as an AWS Well-Architected Partner, our consultant will work as a designated partner with your tech team. They will collectively go through a set of questions centered around the 5 pillars of the Well-Architected Framework to identify risk areas.

How It Works

1. Time required: 1- 4 hours are usually what it takes to give a good review. Time should preferably be at the end of the workday to avoid delivery lags and gauge stakeholders’ wave-length.
2. Participating stakeholders: To give a full review the ideal participants should be a decision-maker in the tech team (a VP or Head), or a DevOps consultant, or a representative from the sales team.
3. Pre-requisites: Our consultant would need to have access to your Amazon Web Services account along with workload location and existing architectural diagrams.
4. Review: This takes place with a basic set of questions based on the 5 pillars. Your existing architecture is tested against these questions and remedies are proposed.
5. Remediation: This involves optimizing the workload or removing any critical issues to ensure smooth operations. It provides visibility into your infrastructural changes, reduces costs, and enhances compliance.
