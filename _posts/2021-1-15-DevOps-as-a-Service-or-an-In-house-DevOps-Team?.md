title: DevOps as a Service or an In-house DevOps Team?
---

DevOps was born because of the desperate need to get the right deployment of the software code by the right people. Earlier, software operators were responsible for deploying and maintaining the code developed by tech developers. However, developers didn’t know the fundamentals of deployment, and operators didn’t know how to move fast while keeping the code stable. Hence, both teams couldn’t work in sync.

**Enter DevOps.**

This meant the teams could now collaborate and thus deliver the application/service more efficiently. Therefore, [DevOps](https://theagileadmin.com/what-is-devops/ "DevOps") is a culture that aligns different aspects of an organization including, philosophies, tools, and people with the IT infrastructure.

You can choose between - DaaS (DevOps as a Service) offered by AWS certified DevOps partners or hire your in-house DevOps teams.

**What is DevOps?**

In simple words, DevOps is a cultural marriage between the application development and technology deployment teams. AWS Certified DevOps partners such as Zero & One work as an integrated team to [build, test, release, and monitor applications](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/#:~:text=The%20DevOps%20model%20relies%20on,that%20is%20enabled%20by%20DevOps. "build, test, release, and monitor applications").

Therefore, DevOps continuously improves and automates workflows to manage cloud services and applications.

**Why does this matter?**

These partners help to accelerate the time to market of your application/service and save the overall costs of your business. They achieve this by using off-the-shelf templates while applying DevOps.

**What is DevOps as a Service?**

DevOps as a Service operates on a ‘pay-as-you-go’ model. This cloud service helps to assess, automate, and manage the workflows using stackable virtual tools. These tools help the development and operations teams to collaborate, produce, and manage applications with efficiency.

_DevOps Competency Partners_ offer continuous integration and delivery of DevOps, service monitoring, and performance tracking. This approach helps in automating most of the part of the application lifecycle process. Thus, you don’t need to manually coordinate with different teams anymore.

**What about the In-house DevOps Team?**

Imagine developing the entire process listed above from scratch? It will lead to wastage of your time, effort, and costs. Unless you are a tech company that wouldn’t want to outsource this function, we recommend using DevOps as a Service.

**Three Reasons Why You Need DevOps as a Service**

DaaS has various advantages over the traditional in-house DevOps teams. DevOps as a Service offers virtual stackable tools to churn fast code with reduced costs.

1. Faster Deployment: One of the prominent challenges that businesses have been able to overcome using DevOps services is the reduced time to market. The ready-to-use templates and specialized tools make the flow of information highly decluttered. No one needs to know how the whole toolchain functions. End users value the company’s competency. The result of this approach is one-click deployment and [rollback with automated alerts](https://shadow-soft.com/why-devops-important/ "rollback with automated alerts").

2. Centralized Log Management: Since all the processes are [automated](https://mediatemple.net/blog/cloud-hosting/four-ways-aws-benefits-devops-teams/ "automated"), DaaS makes it easier for its stakeholders to access log management. This means you control your data security and you can monitor the performance of your applications. While the in-house DevOps team can be a great idea, DevOps as a Service certainly gives an outer perspective (read feedback), thus helping to improvise better.

3. Cost Efficient: Businesses focus on being agile yet efficient. AWS consulting partners like Zero&One helps businesses to get access to AWS Certified DevOps professionals who help in cost optimization. One of the overhead costs of an In-house DevOps team is the cost of employees. Along with hefty paychecks, companies are required to spend on their training and to take advanced software licensing. DaaS on the other hand reduces these fixed costs and lets you focus on customer success.

Other reasons include better disaster recovery and enhanced infrastructure security which shows that DevOps as a Service should be your preferred choice.

**Finally, DevOps as a Service or an In-house DevOps Team?**

As an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner we recommend, DevOps as Service. The simple reason is that it is cost-friendly and shifts the workload from in-house teams to DaaS providers. While in-house DevOps teams seem bankable, they can be extremely hard to manage with soaring costs and app complexities. They often lack automated alerting, thus increasing risk.

DaaS on the other hand is backed by enterprise-level tools that automate processes right-away (cultural level shift still takes time though). Also, as it is a pay-as-you-go service, you can use it only when required, just like cloud computing.
While the choice is certainly yours, just remember that your clients bank on you for their infrastructure. Aim to serve them with the highest level of tech sophistication to gain market trust, better growth, and happy clients.
